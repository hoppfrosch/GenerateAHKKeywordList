# Generate AHK-Language Database #

Generate a Database (sqlite) containing names of language elements (built-in variables, functions ...) of [AutoHotkey](http://ahkscript.org/) programming language.

This is done by parsing the [sourcecode of AutoHotkey](https://github.com/Lexikos/AutoHotkey_L).

This information can be used for example to create keywordlists for highlighting within several editors ...
